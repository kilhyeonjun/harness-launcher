# Architecture and trust boundaries

## Overview

`harness-launcher` is a shell and executable adapter. It registers a project directory as a short profile command, translates presets into runtime arguments, prepares project-scoped runtime state, and then hands control to the selected CLI.

```text
~/.zshrc
  └─ harness_register <project>
       └─ reads config/launcher.env
            └─ defines <prefix>() and completion
                 ├─ Claude Code
                 ├─ Codex CLI  → prepare .harness/codex
                 └─ Kiro CLI   → prepare .harness/kiro
```

External orchestrators use the same runner through a registered executable profile or `harness-exec` rather than depending on shell startup:

```text
workspace manager
  └─ <profile-prefix> ...
       └─ harness-exec <project> ...
       └─ the same _harness_launcher_run policy path
```

The current workspace is adopted only when its canonical path resolves inside the registered project; explicit `--cwd` uses the same boundary. Workspace managers own UI and worktree lifecycle; the launcher continues to own runtime homes, auth routing, MCP, skills, hooks, presets, and observability.

The launcher is not a model proxy and does not host an API. Gateway modes are optional routes to user-configured external processes.

## Registration

Each project provides:

```bash
# config/launcher.env
HARNESS_NAME="Example harness"
HARNESS_PREFIX="ex"
```

`harness_register` resolves the project to an absolute path, sources `launcher.env`, defines the prefix function, and attaches completion when Zsh's `compdef` is available. `harness-profile register` persists the same prefix as an executable command without copying policy. `harness-auto` uses the Python `harness_profile_resolver.py` to read only regular registry entries, resolve the canonical current directory, and select the single longest owning boundary before delegating to `harness-exec`; it never guesses from a repository name or remote. `--explain` uses the same resolver without launching an agent.

`harness_shell_enable` is an opt-in interactive adapter over that executable
boundary. It keeps its activation flag as an unexported Zsh global, so the
child `harness-exec` shell cannot reactivate the wrapper and recurse. The
launcher-owned `codex` function switches to `harness-auto codex`; a temporary
launcher-owned `claude` function classifies only its first argument. Native
Claude management subcommands use an internal `claude-management` route;
everything else uses `harness-auto claude base`. The management route preserves
argv and the selected project's PWD, loads its local environment, and returns
before model/effort, MCP-argument, observability, title, or session-isolation
mutation. It deliberately does not inject the launcher's Claude session MCP
overlay: `claude mcp list` reports what the native CLI discovers from user and
project configuration. Authentication remains in Claude's native user-global
store rather than becoming profile-local. `harness_shell_disable` removes only
the exact Claude function it installed. Existing aliases/functions are never
overwritten, and `command codex` / `command claude` bypass functions without
modifying `PATH`.

Because `launcher.env` is sourced, registration is a trust decision. The launcher does not attempt to parse or sandbox arbitrary shell code in that file.

Native Codex entrypoints treat `HARNESS_CODEX_GLOBAL_MCP_ALLOWLIST` as trusted launcher configuration, not an ambient user-shell setting. Immediately before each `codex-home-prepare.sh` child, they trim and deduplicate it and either export the resulting nonempty comma-separated list or unset it. This makes consecutive configured, explicitly empty, and absent values independent.

## Command routing

The prefix function and executable profile both delegate through `harness-exec` to `_harness_launcher_run`:

```text
ex                         interactive TUI
ex <mode>                  direct Claude Code
ex fable                   direct Claude Code, fable alias + high effort
ex codex <profile>         native Codex CLI
ex kiro-cli <mode>         native Kiro CLI
ex kiro <mode>             Claude Code through a Kiro gateway
ex codex-gateway <mode>    Claude Code through a Codex gateway
```

Runtime-specific arguments remain arrays until execution. The launcher passes unknown arguments through to the selected CLI.

In shell-auto mode, PWD remains the profile-selection authority. Explicit
Codex `--cd`, `--cd=`, and `-C` values are canonicalized and must exist inside
the selected harness boundary. An outside PWD cannot select a profile by
pointing `--cd` inward, and an inside PWD cannot escape outward through a later
Codex argument. Claude management classification is intentionally first-token
only, so prompt text (`claude 'mcp list'`), `-p doctor`, and tokens after `--`
remain session launches. Option-before-subcommand syntax is not reordered;
`command claude` is the native escape for that form.

## Binary selection

Native Codex uses this precedence:

```text
HARNESS_CODEX_BIN
  → codex resolved from PATH
  → Codex.app bundled CLI only when HARNESS_CODEX_ALLOW_APP_FALLBACK=1
```

Kiro follows the same explicit-override pattern through `HARNESS_KIRO_BIN`, then `kiro-cli` from `PATH`.

This order matters on macOS because an app-bundled CLI or a version-manager shim can differ from the executable expected by the user. Verify binary selection from the same login shell that loads the launcher.

## Generated runtime homes

The launcher keeps project-specific state under:

```text
<project>/.harness/codex
<project>/.harness/kiro
```

These directories can contain generated config, session history, plugin state, hooks, skills, and links to the active runtime auth store. They should be ignored by Git and treated as disposable output.

User-authored sources live outside `.harness`:

```text
config/launcher.env
config/codex-surface.json
.mcp.json
.mcp.local.json
mcp.local.json
mcp.kiro.local.json
.claude/skills/
.codex-only/skills/
.claude/settings.local.json
config/.local/
```

Preparation is idempotent. Re-running a launcher command converges generated files to the current source configuration.

When `config/codex-surface.json` is present, it is the membership boundary for generated Codex skills, imported Claude plugins, Codex-only profiles, and enabled MCP servers. Host tokens are expanded at preparation time. The generated catalog records exact source paths and hashes; it is evidence, not source.

## MCP configuration

Committed MCP definitions can live in `.mcp.json`. Machine-local additions can live in `.mcp.local.json` or `mcp.local.json`.

Those three files are shared by every runtime. `mcp.kiro.local.json` is read only by Kiro preparation, which is the supported way to give one runtime a server the others must not receive; Claude and Codex preparation never read it.

For a local stdio script, use `${HARNESS_ROOT}/core/scripts/example.sh` in `command` or `args` when the path belongs to the registered harness. The launcher resolves this explicit prefix against the canonical harness root, checks that the result is a file inside that root, and passes the resulting absolute path to Claude, Codex, and Kiro. It leaves URLs, credentials, environment fields, and other arguments unchanged. Bare relative script paths for `bash`, `sh`, `zsh`, `python`, and `node` fail before launch with a migration hint. The source JSON remains the definition authority; `.harness/claude/mcp-full.json`, Codex TOML, and Kiro JSON are derived runtime artifacts, so starting in `projects/` or a nested worktree does not change a script's meaning. Isolated Claude sessions put their full/light MCP artifacts in the session state directory outside the Git worktree and write them owner-only (0600), keeping local definitions and credentials out of submission. This root-path rule adds no always-on policy clause; it replaces the previous runtime-dependent relative-path interpretation.

Runtimes differ in how an authenticated HTTP MCP server reaches its endpoint. Claude expands `${VAR}` in headers itself, Codex preparation translates an `Authorization: Bearer ${VAR}` header into `bearer_token_env_var`, and Kiro CLI supports neither: its agent schema takes only `url` into account for http transport, so a header-authenticated server falls into OAuth discovery and fails. Kiro preparation therefore rewrites such a server into a pinned `mcp-remote` stdio bridge carrying the same headers, leaving `${VAR}` unresolved so the bridge substitutes it from the inherited environment. HTTP servers without headers, and servers already using stdio, are untouched. The SSH-tunnel light filter runs before translation, so a loopback tunnel server is still dropped rather than bridged.

The launcher rejects duplicate server names across these files. Local config extends committed config; it does not override it silently. Native Kiro validates and renders MCP configuration in external staging before it materializes a runtime home: a duplicate leaves an existing `.harness/kiro` unchanged and creates no `.harness/kiro` state for a fresh project.

Codex preparation translates supported MCP entries into TOML:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@example/docs-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

```toml
[mcp_servers.docs]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@example/docs-mcp"]
```

HTTP bearer values should be represented through environment-variable references. Generated config stores the variable name, not the secret value.

An exact Codex surface can additionally declare `codex-global-allowlist` as an MCP definition source. That source projects only names selected by `HARNESS_CODEX_GLOBAL_MCP_ALLOWLIST` from `$HOME/.codex/config.toml`; the global file is the definition authority, while the exact profile remains the enablement authority. The launcher rejects duplicate names across every selected source instead of selecting one implicitly. Static `env` and `http_headers` fields are rejected: use `env_vars`, `env_http_headers`, or `bearer_token_env_var` references so generated project state never copies secret values.

## Global state and concurrency

Most Codex state is project-scoped, but bundled plugin caches and the Chrome native-host bridge can use global `~/.codex` paths. These writes are a cross-project critical section.

On macOS, preparation opens a persistent lock file and acquires `/usr/bin/lockf` on an inherited descriptor. The kernel holds the lock for the protected subshell lifetime, including signal and child-process cases. The lock file can remain on disk after release; successful reacquisition proves that no process still owns it.

Do not replace this with PID files, mtime-based stale reclamation, or signal cleanup that removes a directory while child work continues.

### Isolated harness sessions

The opt-in isolated-session canary separates three paths:

- `HARNESS_SOURCE_ROOT` owns the canonical Git directory, product checkouts, and machine-local configuration.
- `HARNESS_SESSION_ROOT` is a detached, per-UUID repository with a distinct Git directory and no remote, containing the session's tracked harness state and private index.
- `HARNESS_RUN_DIR` is the runtime working directory: the session root for harness work, or the original product worktree selected with `--cwd`.

Machine-local MCP files are referenced from the canonical source and excluded
from submissions. `config/.local` is read from the source boundary and is never
copied. A heartbeat keeps live `OPEN` sessions from being declared abandoned;
the UUID workspace remains recoverable after an unclean exit.

Profiles may default only fresh interactive direct-Claude and native-Codex
routes into this boundary. The router classifies arguments before allocating a
UUID: non-interactive, batch, help, diagnostics, gateway/Kiro, and no-argument
TUI routes remain legacy (an explicit `--isolated` still isolates them and
runs in the session root), while generic continuation commands require either an
exact `--isolated-session <uuid>` or an intentional `--no-isolated` rollback.
Argument classification stops at the prompt/freeform boundary so prompt text
that resembles a launcher switch cannot alter isolation.

Each lease-v1 session has a per-UUID `runtime.lock`. The launcher acquires it
before resume and holds it for the complete runtime; its close-on-exec descriptor
prevents runtime, heartbeat, and title-broker children from extending ownership.
`OPEN` can resume only while that launcher lease is held. `ABANDONED`,
`CONFLICT`, and retained `CLOSED` records reopen the same UUID; `SUBMITTED` and
`INTEGRATING` require delivery recovery; `DELIVERED` and `DISCARDED` are
permanently terminal (`resume` and `recover` refuse them).

`harness-session discard <uuid>` retires an `ABANDONED` or `CONFLICT` session
whose work will not be delivered (for example, work another session already
delivered). It runs under the global integration lock and takes the session's
runtime lease without waiting, as garbage collection does; a held lease
refuses. Before any state change it writes `discarded.patch` into the record:
the binary diff of the work tree against `base-sha`, staged through a
temporary copy of the index that submit would stage (the session's own index
for interactive sessions, the `trusted.git` index for headless ones) with the
session's broker git, plus `discarded-at` (UTC). Starting from that index
keeps the patch equal to what `close` would deliver: force-added ignored files
stay, files removed with `git rm --cached` and now ignored stay deleted,
untracked files are added, and other gitignored files and the excluded
machine-local paths are left out. Neither the session index nor a headless
session's `.git` is written. The diff format is fixed (`--no-color
--no-ext-diff --no-textconv --src-prefix=a/ --dst-prefix=b/`), so user diff
settings cannot change the patch. Completeness rests on the exit status of
every step (index copy, `add`, `diff`) and on the rename that publishes the
patch only after git wrote it; the patch, `discarded-at` and the record
directory are fsynced before the journal changes. Any failure refuses and
changes nothing. Only then does the journal become `DISCARDED`, keeping the
identity a `CONFLICT` carried. `DISCARDED` is reachable only through
`discard`: `harness-session transition <uuid> DISCARDED` refuses, and every
reopen to `OPEN` removes a leftover `discarded.patch` and `discarded-at`.
`OPEN` (use `exit` or `close`), `SUBMITTED` and `INTEGRATING` (possibly
indeterminate; use `recover`), `CLOSED`, `DELIVERED` and `DISCARDED` refuse
with exit 2.

State transitions: `OPEN` → `SUBMITTED` | `CLOSED` | `ABANDONED`;
`SUBMITTED` ⇄ `INTEGRATING`; `INTEGRATING` → `DELIVERED` | `CONFLICT`;
`ABANDONED`, `CONFLICT`, `CLOSED` → `OPEN`; `ABANDONED`, `CONFLICT` →
`DISCARDED`.

Serialized garbage collection retains nonterminal, malformed, legacy, future-
dated, leased, and within-grace records. For an expired `CLOSED`, `DELIVERED`
or `DISCARDED` record (`DISCARDED` only with its `discarded.patch`), it
rereads state while holding the runtime lease, validates that the workspace is the canonical state directory's exact direct child, renames it to
a same-parent tombstone, and removes only that tombstone. The durable journal is
retained. The default grace is 24 hours and the accepted range is 0–7 days.

Delivery has one kernel-locked lane per host. The session submits a base SHA,
binary patch, NUL-delimited path/mode/blob manifest, canonical source, and
canonical remote bound by one digest and rechecked before and after verification.
The broker clones the current remote tip, requires the repository-owned
auto-delivery verifier on the staged candidate, applies the patch three-way,
and performs a non-force push. Remote movement before that push discards the
candidate and reruns apply plus verification. The successful push is the remote
compare-and-swap acknowledgement; a fresh clone must then contain the delivered
SHA as an ancestor and reproduce its exact path/mode/blob manifest before the
journal can become `DELIVERED`. A later remote descendant therefore cannot turn
an accepted delivery into a false conflict. Independent hosts rely on the remote
non-fast-forward comparison; they never bypass it with force push. A crash in
`INTEGRATING`, including between remote acceptance and the local acknowledgement,
reconciles a proven pushed candidate to `DELIVERED` or returns an unpushed
submission to `SUBMITTED`. Clean close or normal exit records terminal `CLOSED`.

Manifest-enabled homes also keep an atomic successful-input fingerprint plus a source-identity watch snapshot. The lean warm path validates watched file identities, semantic TOML policy, launcher-owned output hashes, product-plugin skill digests, explicit-only policies, skill/plugin directory topology, every managed skill link, and the normalized global-MCP definition digest before returning; it does not rescan plugin tests/docs/assets. Changing selected global definitions or allowlist membership therefore invalidates the warm path. Unexpected generated-home skill routes force a cold rebuild and reversible quarantine, and marker membership alone never proves ownership. Auth contents, sessions, hook trust state, and generated output mtimes remain runtime state and do not invalidate source generation. A cold rebuild leaves the live success stamp in place while it prepares a candidate transaction, then publishes the replacement success stamp last.

### Headless isolated runs

`harness-headless <profile> --prompt-file F --result-file R --lock-file L --budget-usd N --timeout-min M [--settings-file S] [--model X]`
runs one unattended Claude task for a registered profile. It is the only
non-interactive route that works inside an isolated session. Interactive and
legacy routes do not change.

- **Lock and lifetime.** It holds an exclusive `flock` on `L` from start until
  the result file is in place, including delivery, and stays in the
  foreground. A held lock exits 75 and leaves `R` alone; any other lock error
  exits 2 with a `refused` result when `R` is writable. `SIGTERM`, `SIGINT` and
  `SIGHUP` kill the run's process group, write a `failed` result (`exit_code`
  128 + signal), and only then release the lock.
- **Environment.** Only `HOME`, `PATH`, `USER`, `LOGNAME`, `SHELL`, `LANG` and
  `LC_*` pass through, plus `HARNESS_SESSION_STATE_HOME` and
  `XDG_STATE_HOME` so the launcher finds the same session state. It adds
  `HARNESS_HEADLESS=1`, `HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN` (the resolved interpreter),
  `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, `HARNESS_COMMIT_MESSAGE_FILE` (see **Commit
  message**), and `TMPDIR` and `CLAUDE_CODE_TMPDIR` both set to a
  fresh `/private/tmp/hh-*` directory (0700, owned by the user, short enough
  for Claude's per-uid socket directory), so the shared
  `/private/tmp/claude-<uid>` can stay write-denied. That directory is
  removed before delivery and on every exit path. With `HARNESS_HEADLESS=1` the launcher does not
  export the harness `.claude/settings.local.json` `env` block, does not derive
  a per-harness `GH_TOKEN`, and passes no `--mcp-config`.
- **Session.** It calls `harness-exec <harness> --isolated --passthrough ...`,
  so the launcher creates the journal and lease itself and the run directory
  is the session root. The headless clone uses `git clone --no-hardlinks`,
  copies `.mcp.local.json`, `mcp.local.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json`
  (without its `env` block) instead of linking them, never links `projects/`,
  and refuses a symlink on any of those paths. Before the agent starts it
  writes a `headless` marker and a launcher-owned bare git dir
  (`trusted.git`, the base commit and a matching index) into the session
  record, outside every sandbox write path.
- **Claude.** `claude -p --output-format json --max-budget-usd N
  --permission-mode acceptEdits --strict-mcp-config [--model X]`, with the
  prompt on stdin, in its own process group without a controlling terminal.
  The launcher merges every `--settings` into one (dicts merge, lists are
  unions, the last scalar wins): its launch-record settings, the session
  settings, the caller's `S`, and the mandatory containment, passed last.
  - `disableAllHooks: true` (project hooks run outside the sandbox) and
    `disableBypassPermissionsMode: "disable"`. Hooks are off, so headless runs
    write no launch record; a later `resume` of such a Claude session gets the
    default permissions.
  - `sandbox`: `enabled`, `failIfUnavailable`, `allowUnsandboxedCommands:
    false`, `autoAllowBashIfSandboxed`, `network.strictAllowlist` with an empty
    `network.allowedDomains`; `filesystem.denyRead` for `~/.hermes`, `~/buzz`,
    `~/.ssh`, `~/.config/gh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.claude`, the source root and the
    caller's paths; `filesystem.denyWrite` for `/private/tmp/claude-<uid>`,
    `/tmp/claude-<uid>` and the session `.git/config`, `.git/hooks` and
    `.git/info`; `filesystem.allowWrite` for the run's temp directory.
  - `permissions.deny`: `Read` on every `denyRead` path; `Edit`, `Write` and
    `NotebookEdit` on those paths, `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, the temp
    directories and the session git config, hooks and info; `WebFetch`;
    `WebSearch`; Bash rules matching `harness-session`, `session-isolation.sh`,
    `auto-deliver`, `git push`, `sudo` and `launchctl` anywhere in the
    command; and `hermes`, `buzz` and `rm -rf` as prefixes.
  - `S` may contain only `_note`, `permissions.deny`,
    `sandbox.filesystem.denyRead` and `sandbox.network.allowedDomains` (string
    lists, added to the mandatory ones). Any other key is `refused`.
- **Commit message.** The broker delivers the work tree as one commit; the
  agent's own commits are not kept as commits. `harness-headless` appends a
  delivery note to the prompt asking the agent to write that commit's message
  to `$HARNESS_COMMIT_MESSAGE_FILE`, `<run temp dir>/commit-message`, which
  the sandbox lets Bash write. After Claude exits and lingering processes are
  killed, and before the temp directory is removed, it reads the file without
  following a symlink or blocking (`O_NOFOLLOW|O_NONBLOCK`), only if it is a
  regular file with a single link, of at most 8192 bytes of strict UTF-8. It
  turns CRLF, CR, U+2028 and U+2029 into LF, removes every other control
  character (C0, C1, DEL; NUL and ESC included) except TAB
  (so ESC and terminal sequences cannot reach a terminal that shows `git
  log`) and every Unicode format character (bidi overrides, zero-width), removes
  CI-skip directives (`[skip ci]`, `[ci skip]`, `[no ci]`, `[skip actions]`,
  `[actions skip]`, case-insensitive) so the
  delivered commit cannot switch off the repository's checks, strips trailing
  whitespace, drops leading and trailing blank lines and any trailer line whose
  key is `Harness-Session` or `skip-checks` when compared loosely (NFKC, so
  full-width letters and colons fold; case-insensitive; spaces, hyphens and
  underscores in the key ignored; leading whitespace allowed). Other trailers and
  GitHub keywords such as `Fixes #12` pass through unchanged. The message is
  used only if the subject is non-empty and at most 100 characters and there
  are at most 200 lines. It is written atomically (0600) to the
  launcher-owned record, `<record>/commit-message`, which the agent sandbox
  cannot write, only when the run goes to delivery, right before the broker
  runs; a timeout, budget, failed or refused run never records it, so a
  session resumed and closed later by its owner gets the generic message. A
  `printf` or `echo` command whose text trips a Bash deny rule (it contains
  `harness-session`, `git push` or another denied word) is refused by the
  sandbox, so such a message is never written and the generic one is used.
  The broker commits with that message, a blank line and `Harness-Session:
  <uuid>` (`git commit --cleanup=whitespace -F`, same `harness-broker`
  identity) when the record holds a regular, non-symlink `commit-message`, in
  headless and interactive sessions alike; otherwise with `harness session
  <uuid>`. Anything else (no file, a symlink, a FIFO, too large, invalid
  UTF-8, an invalid subject, an I/O error) falls back to the generic message.
  For a delivery, the run log names the source used (`harness-headless: commit message:
  agent` or `generic (<reason>)`); the result file does not change. The
  agent's `.git` is never read for this.
- **Timeout.** After `M` minutes (fractions allowed) the whole process group
  gets `SIGTERM`, then `SIGKILL`. Status `timeout`, `exit_code` 124. The
  session is left for its owner.
- **Delivery.** After Claude exits, `harness-headless` kills its process
  group and then every remaining process of the user whose cwd or open file
  is inside the session root or the run's temp directory (one `lsof`
  snapshot), and removes that temp directory. Only then does the broker run,
  with the caller's `TMPDIR` and no `CLAUDE_CODE_TMPDIR`, so broker git and
  the repository verifier never write or execute files where the sandboxed
  agent could write. Broker git on a headless
  session (`exit`, `submit`, `close`; decided only by the marker) never reads
  the session's `.git`: it runs `git --git-dir=<record>/trusted.git
  --work-tree=<session root>` with `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1`,
  `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null`, `core.fsmonitor=false`,
  `core.hooksPath=/dev/null`, `submodule.recurse=false`, an empty
  `diff.external` and `core.untrackedCache=false`. The session's config,
  hooks, modules and alternates are never read, and a work-tree
  `.gitattributes` names filter or diff drivers that are not defined, so they
  are no-ops. The work tree holds the final content whether or not the agent
  committed, so `add -A -- .` captures it all; the excluded paths
  (`config/.local`, `projects`, `.mcp.local.json`, `mcp.local.json`,
  `.claude/settings.local.json`) are listed in the trusted git dir's
  `info/exclude` and reset to the base afterwards, so neither a new file nor
  an edit to a tracked file there is delivered. `add` never names them: an
  exclude pathspec naming a gitignored file makes `git add -A` exit 1. The
  reset and the diff pathspecs match case-insensitively, because the agent
  can negate ignore rules in `.gitignore` and write `Projects/` or
  `config/.LOCAL/`. Git folds only ASCII case, while APFS also folds Unicode
  (`projectſ` with U+017F is `projects` on disk), so every staged path is
  also checked against probe trees of the excluded entries on the session
  volume and on the source checkout's volume (they differ when the state
  home is elsewhere); a path the filesystem resolves to an excluded entry is reset (or,
  for an interactive commit, refused) the same way. Names the filesystem
  keeps distinct, such as `projects.` or `projects` with a trailing space,
  are ordinary paths, and a symlink into `projects/` is delivered as the
  link itself. A broker git error is never read as an answer: a failed
  listing is not "nothing to exclude", a failed change check is not "no
  changes" (the session is kept, not closed), and a failed tree listing is
  not a deletion. Each stops the close before anything is pushed.
  Without global config, global excludes (for example a global `.DS_Store`
  ignore) do not apply; the repository `.gitignore` does. A marker without
  its `trusted.git` refuses (exit 6, status `refused`), and so does a source
  checkout that has moved or been deleted (exit 8, status `refused`; the
  session is kept). A changed session goes
  to `ABANDONED`, a clean one to `CLOSED`. A changed session is recovered and
  closed through the broker. A journal still `INTEGRATING` after close is
  recovered once. `DELIVERED` gives `delivered` with the `delivered-sha`
  readback commit; close exit 3 or 5 gives `conflict` (session kept); exit 9,
  the repository verifier rejected the candidate, gives `failed` (session
  kept); anything else is `failed`.
- **Verifier sandbox.** The repository verifier (`core/bin/auto-deliver.sh`
  from the trusted baseline, run `--staged-only --dry-run --no-push`) runs the
  candidate's tests, which the agent may have written. For headless sessions
  the broker runs it under `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec` with a generated Seatbelt
  profile, on a throwaway copy of the candidate that the broker deletes and
  never reads back; the broker commits and pushes from the candidate itself
  (no hooks, fsmonitor or external drivers), so nothing a test writes into
  the copy's `.git` or work tree runs or is delivered. The profile denies by
  default and allows only: fork, and exec of binaries under `/usr`, `/bin`,
  `/sbin`, `/System`, `/Library/Developer`, the Homebrew prefix, mise and
  other `PATH` directories (never `/` or a directory holding `HOME` or the
  state home), the copy, the temp dir and the trusted verifier; reads of
  those trees plus `/Library/Developer`, `/Library/Frameworks`,
  `/Library/Apple` and `/Library/Perl` (not Application Support,
  Preferences, Logs or Keychains), `/private/var/db/timezone`,
  `/private/var/select`, `/dev` and a few `/private/etc` files (`hosts`,
  `passwd`, `group`, `localtime`, `services`, `protocols`, `shells`, `ssl`),
  with the Homebrew `etc` and `var` denied except its OpenSSL and CA config;
  file metadata anywhere (path resolution: `stat`, not directory listings);
  `sysctl` reads except the process table (`kern.proc`); no network at all,
  except unix sockets inside the verifier's temp dir (no loopback services,
  no Docker socket, no `PF_SYSTEM` kernel-control sockets); writes only
  to the copy, a fresh per-verify temp dir outside `HOME` (`TMPDIR` under
  `/private/tmp`, removed afterwards), `/dev/null`, `/dev/tty`,
  `/dev/dtracehelper` and `/dev/fd`. The state home (other sessions'
  worktrees, records and trusted git dirs) is denied even when a `PATH`
  directory holds it, with only the copy and the trusted verifier inside it
  allowed again. Nothing under `HOME` or the state home is
  readable except the copy, the temp dir, the trusted verifier and toolchains
  (mise's installs, cache and `~/.config/mise/config.toml`, `PATH`
  directories), and never `~/.ssh`, `~/.hermes`, `~/buzz`, `~/.config/gh`,
  `~/.aws`, `~/.claude`, `~/Library/Keychains`, `~/.git-credentials`,
  `~/.netrc`, `~/.config/git` or the source checkout.
  User git config is not readable; the verifier gets a generated global git
  config (`GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`, identity only), and neither the copy nor the
  trusted clone keeps a remote, so no remote URL with credentials is
  readable. No mach services
  except user and group lookup and logging (so no keychain, launchd job
  submission, LaunchServices `open`, XPC services or AppleEvents); signals
  and process inspection only within the sandbox. A nested `sandbox-exec`
  fails. The environment is `HOME`, `PATH`, `LANG`, `LC_*`, `TMPDIR` and the
  verifier's own switches plus `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`; agent sockets, askpass
  helpers, `GH_*`, `GITHUB_*`, `ANTHROPIC_*`, `OPENAI_*`, `CLAUDE_*` and
  tokens are not passed. Interactive sessions run the verifier as before.
- **Result.** Written atomically (temp file and rename) to `R`, always with
  `"version": 1`:
  `{"version":1,"status":"delivered|no_changes|conflict|failed|timeout|budget|refused","session_id":<launcher UUID|null>,"commit":<sha|null>,"cost_usd":<float|null>,"num_turns":<int|null>,"summary":<Claude result, at most 3000 chars>,"transcript":<path|null>,"exit_code":<int>,"started_at":<epoch>,"ended_at":<epoch>}`.
  `budget` is Claude subtype `error_max_budget_usd`; `failed` covers other
  Claude errors, a missing Claude result, signals and delivery failures.
  `refused` (`exit_code` 2 before launch) means the run could not start
  without input or broke containment: an unknown profile, a host
  without `/usr/bin/lockf` (delivery could never lock), a host without
  `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec` or where the verifier profile does not load (checked
  with `harness-session sandbox-check`), an empty or
  unreadable prompt, a non-positive budget or timeout, a settings key outside
  the allowed set, a refused headless clone, or a headless record without its
  trusted git dir.
  Launcher and Claude stderr go to `R.log`. The command exits 0 whenever `R`
  was written and nonzero otherwise.

Bash deny rules match command text and are guardrails only; containment
comes from the mandatory sandbox. User and project settings files still merge
under the flag settings.

### Restore fidelity and the launch record

A host restore (`claude --resume <id>`, `codex resume <id>`) restores the
session's model and effort from its transcript or rollout, and its permission or
sandbox grant from a launch record. The two sources have different trust:

- A transcript or rollout is written by the agent, so the launcher treats it as
  untrusted data. It is read by a bounded helper (no symlink or non-regular file,
  last 8 MiB, time limit), and only model and effort are taken, each re-validated
  against a fixed vocabulary before use. A forged `permissionMode`,
  `approval_policy` or `sandbox_policy` in it is never read.
- The launch record is written by the launcher's own `SessionStart` hook from the
  grant the launcher exported for that launch, under
  `<state>/launch-records/<agent>-<session_id>` with mode 0600.
  The launcher never escalates: without a record it keeps the default grant and
  prints the command that relaunches with bypass. A record is honoured only for its own harness root,
  and it is also the only proof that a Claude session lives outside an isolated
  root. The record protects against content in agent-written session files; it
  does not stop a process running as the same user from writing the file, exactly
  like every other file in the state directory.

Three details keep the record honest. A Claude hook takes its grant as command
arguments inside the launcher's `--settings`, never from the environment, because
Claude applies the agent-writable `env` block of `.claude/settings.local.json`.
Codex's `hooks.json` row is static, so it reads the launcher's environment, and
`$CODEX_HOME` (`.harness/codex`) sits inside the workspace-write root, which makes it a
pre-existing lever inside the same boundary. Whether a launch is nested is decided by
the hook from process ancestry (a second `claude` or `codex` executable above the agent
that ran the hook), not from environment variables, so a stale agent environment in a
pane shell does not demote a restore and `env -u CLAUDECODE` does not promote a nested
launch. A nested launch may keep or lower a record's grant and never raise it, and it
can create a grant-less `isolated=0` record, which only enables the legacy route: an
isolated owner still wins. The nesting rule stops accidental nesting, not a deliberate
agent: a same-user process can still write the record file directly, double-fork so it
is reparented to launchd, or type the launch into a pane shell (herdr, tmux, osascript),
and each of these counts as top-level. That stays the documented same-user boundary.

Known limits, kept on purpose:

- A raw `codex exec` or `codex exec resume` inside a Codex agent inherits the parent's
  `HARNESS_LAUNCH_*` environment, but its own hook sees the parent `codex` as an ancestor
  and is treated as nested. Ancestry recognises only executables named exactly `claude`
  or `codex`; an agent started through a wrapper with another name, such as an npm
  install whose process is named `node`, is not seen, and the walk then treats the next
  recognised ancestor as the owner.
- The hook reads the process table with `ps`. Where that fails, for example if a Codex
  hook runs inside a sandbox that denies it, the launch counts as nested and records no
  grant. The opt-in Codex row has not been checked against a real Codex session.
- A caller `--settings` after `--passthrough` replaces the launcher's, so that launch has no record.
- A planted canonical rollout in the source `CODEX_HOME` can steer a restore to the legacy route.
- The Codex hook row names the Python interpreter by its Cellar path, which changes after `brew upgrade` until the next prepare.

See [Terminal runtimes](terminal-runtimes.md#restore-fidelity) for the argv rules.

## Browser and plugin trust

The launcher can materialize supported Codex bundled plugins when a compatible marketplace source or existing cache is available.

Security rules:

- Terminal Codex does not enable the desktop-only Browser plugin surface.
- Chrome bridge support accepts current and known legacy native-host names.
- `node_repl` trusts exact browser-client SHA-256 values.
- Project-writable `CODEX_HOME` and global `~/.codex` directories are not added as broad trusted code paths.
- Codex folder trust: generated `config.toml` keeps the user's `[projects."<path>"]` decisions and adds `trust_level = "trusted"` only for the launcher's own roots (the harness root, plus the source and session roots of an isolated session), keyed by physical path. Nested repositories stay untrusted until the user decides.
- Marketplace synchronization completes before generated config reads plugin versions or browser hashes.
- Complete marketplace content, not one manifest, determines cache freshness.

## Auth boundary

Generated Codex homes link to the active native Codex auth file. The launcher does not copy, serialize, or convert OAuth refresh tokens.

A native account switch therefore happens in the Codex auth store, not by editing each project's generated home. Contributors must not add logs or diagnostics that print auth JSON or environment values.

## Gateway boundary

Gateway modes source local files under `config/.local/` and probe the configured `/health` endpoint before launching Claude Code.

Anything sent through a gateway leaves the local runtime boundary. Users must trust the gateway endpoint and its operator. Gateway configuration and credentials should never be committed.

## Failure behavior

The launcher prefers visible failures over silent fallback when a boundary is ambiguous:

- missing project config stops registration;
- duplicate MCP server names stop launch;
- missing explicit runtime binary stops launch;
- lock acquisition timeout stops shared cache mutation;
- isolated-session apply, verification, remote comparison, or verified readback mismatch remains a recoverable `CONFLICT`; a post-push readback outage remains `INTEGRATING` for remote-history reconciliation;
- failed runtime-home preparation stops the selected runtime;
- app-bundled Codex fallback requires explicit opt-in.
